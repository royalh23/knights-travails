This project implements a graph and breadth-first-search algorithm in order to find the
shortest path between two points that a knight can traverse on a chessboard.

- Learned about graph theory and implemented a knight's graph using an adjaceny list with hash maps;
- Applied breadth-first-search to the graph to find the shortest path between two given nodes by backtracking.
